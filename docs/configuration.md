###Unreal Editor
Once you've got a binary version of the plugin (either by building or downloading) follow these steps:

1. Open **Window->Plugins** from the main menu of the Unreal Editor.
2. Navigate to the **Built-in/Editor/Source Control** or the **Installed/Editor/Source Control** sub-category, you should see the **Mercurial** plugin in the list.
3. Enable the plugin and restart the editor if requested to do so.
4. Click on the **circular red icon** in the top right corner of the Unreal Editor.
5. Select **Mercurial** from the drop-down.
6. If you installed [TortoiseHg](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/) the **Mercurial Executable** should've been auto-detected, otherwise you need to specify the location of the Mercurial executable (hg.exe on Windows, may be just hg elsewhere).
7. Press the **Accept Settings** button to enable the Mercurial source control provider.
